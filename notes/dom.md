# How it works
You connect your habitica account. It then creates a Habit that will penalize each unfinished todo when you start a new day, and reward you when you empty out your todos. This means you have to manage all your todos in this app.

## Todos

* Add todos. You can set priorities, and tags with it.  
* Todos have a `Duration` and `Energy`.  
* You can then schedule todos. You can have it repeat, and it lingers in the todos in habitica unless you uncheck `linger`.

# List
* Name
* Description?
* Duration
* Energy
---
## Sorting
Parent = handles events. Drop zone  
child = Visual only, no mouse events, Tilt animation.

## Grouping
Color scale groups
Add a handle for dragging a group around

# Schedule

* From 
* To
* Repeat
---
* Task will be auto moved to archive when checked in habitica.
* Tasks `linger` by default. If you set this to `false`, then it get moved to archive on the next cron. But you will still get damaged.
